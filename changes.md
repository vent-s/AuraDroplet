- bootstrapped Next.js App Router project structure with TypeScript config and lint setup
- implemented Shopify Storefront helper plus quick checkout, variant lookup, and webhook API routes
- updated hero to feature the product photography on the right with numeric spec rail and refreshed oxide palette supporting the minimal layout
- fixed hero image reference to load the `.jpg` asset now in `public/auradroplet-hero.jpg`
- pushed the entire hero (copy + photography) onto a deep charcoal gradient, keeping specs/buttons legible so both halves live on the same luxurious black backdrop
- refreshed hero with contrast-first chips (USB-C, auto-shutoff, leak-proof cap, dimensions), avatar review link, quiet-power messaging, and sticky mobile CTA; added detail spec grid, JSON-LD product schema, and dedicated reviews block
- overhauled “What’s in the kit” with photography, icon lists, benefit-led copy, tooltip/spec toggle, and mist demo placeholder to make the section breathable and customer-focused
- reoriented hero for conversion (tightened copy, policy line, rating row, availability/payments cues, footnote) and aligned CTAs across header, sticky bar, and hero; added micro-FAQ under CTA plus full FAQ section with schema markup
